Changelog, known bugs, & planned features 

2020-06-09
Spellbinder 1.2b1

1. Added cleaner formatting for strings longer than 79 characters.
2. Expanded spellbook reference during gesture phase. New commands:

Command         Example Description
@g                      Show the spellbook sorted by gesture.
@g<num>         @g27    Show the description of the spell as numbered by @g.
@<spell>        @shield Show the description of the spell by name.
@#<hand><num>   @#r3    Show what spells can be completed by the given hand (r for right, l for left)
#                       Toggle auto-opening of the spellbook at the start of each turn.

3. There is now an option to view a spell's description by sending ? when asked for a target.
4. Clarified Shield description to reflect that it also defends against elemental attacks.
5. Make history automatically move if it is longer than 8 gestures, as no spells are longer than 8.
6. Added an auto-spellbook toggle, activated with #, to make the spellbook automatically open on turn start.

Spellbinder 1.1b1

1.1 is marked by several new features.

1. Added a maximum character limit to the customization phase.
2. Disallowed entries composed entirely of spaces or escape characters in the customization phase.
3. Adding a 'waiting for challenger' message during the 'select target' prompts.
4. Organization of the server code to prevent crashes due to wizard status desync.
5. Wizards are now warned if their gestures would cause a surrender.
6. Slowed the end-round report slightly.
7. Gestures changed by enchantments now show properly.
8. Some detrimental enchantments now show info about them during the gesture phase -- currently: amnesia, blindness, charm, confusion, fear, paralysis.
9. Fixed a bug where paralysis failed to clear the enchantment status, resulting in the paralyzed wizard being immune to further enchantment (unless it was paralysis again)
10. Fully implemented clientside choices for Permanency.

2020-06-08
Spellbinder 1.0b11

 1. NEEDS TESTING: Improvements to network code, especially in relation to Windows clients, especially regarding the end-round report.

2020-06-08
Spellbinder 1.0b10

Fixes for end-round report specific to Windows clients

2020-06-08
Spellbinder 1.0b9

Fixes for end-round report, length can now be indefinite

2020-06-08
Spellbinder 1.0b8

End-round report can now be of indefinite length.
Prevented mysterious circumstances that would result in the end-round report being printed six times at once.

2020-06-07
Spellbinder 1.0b7

Some formatting changes to spellbook display.
You can now see enemy HP during the gesture phase.
Fixed a bug where the gamemaster tried to query non-wizards for wizard-specific attributes.

2020-06-07
Spellbinder 1.0b6

Fixed confusion not clearing from minions properly.
Fixed blank hand messages after paralysis expired (did not have any gameplay effect)
Changed main() invocation

2020-06-07
Spellbinder 1.0b5

Fixed Delayed Effect not asking client for info correctly.

2020-06-07
Spellbinder 1.0b4

Fixed cold resistance vs ice elementals for real this time.

Fixed Charm Person not asking the client for its relevant info.

2020-06-07
Spellbinder 1.0b3

NEEDS TESTING: The game would crash if the end-round report was too large. A fix was implemented in 1.0b2 but needs more testing.

BUGFIX: The client is now asked for a paralysis target properly.
BUGFIX: The client is now asked for an elemental type when summoning.
BUGFIX: Elementals can no longer be targeted on the turn they are summoned.
BUGFIX: Adding flavor messages for enchantments messing with wizard activities was already implemented, just not working properly for some enchantments.

ADDED: The gesture history is now shown after the spellbook is opened.

1. BUG: Strange behavior related to using counter-spell against a target protected by Protection from Evil: keyword, "protective aura fades away". Does not affect gameplay.
2. PLANNED: The clients should be informed during the gesture phase of any minions and elementals on the field.
3. PLANNED: The hand history can grow very long. Start removing old gestures when longer than 8 (the longest spell).
4. PlANNED: Make it more apparent that capital letters in spells mean both hands need to perform the gesture at once.
5. PLANNED: Spellbook option to sort spells by what you may be able to cast with each hand

Spellbinder 1.0b2

 1. BUG: Paralysis asks the server for the hand to enchant, not the client.
 2. BUG: Elemental spells ask the server for the elemental type, not the client.
 3. BUG: Strange behavior related to using counter-spell against a target protected by Protection from Evil: keyword, "protective aura fades away". Does not affect gameplay.
 4. BUG: Elementals can be targeted on the same turn they are summoned. This is a remnant from old code where that was possible.

 5. BUGFIX: The game would crash if the end-round report was too large. This is tentatively fixed but requires more testing.

 6. PLANNED: Adding flavor messages for enchantments interfering with wizard activities.
 7. PLANNED: The clients should be informed during the gesture phase of any minions and elementals on the field.
 8. PLANNED: Display the gesture history after opening your spellbook for easy reference.
 9. PLANNED: The hand history can grow very long. Start removing old gestures when longer than 8 (the longest spell).
10. PlANNED: Make it more apparent that capital letters in spells mean both hands need to perform the gesture at once.

Changelog 2020-06-01

All spells are implemented!

1. Bugfix: Anti-spell: Perceived history of other wizards was not cleared when the other wizard was the subject of an Anti-spell.
2. Bugfix: Charm Person: If Charm Person was permanent on the victim, the victim was allowed to choose who they wanted to stab despite the charmer indicating a target.
3. Bugfix: Enchantments: Changed some enchantments to not rely on the wizard.enchantments property outside of conflict checking -- it should only be used for conflicting enchantments.
4. Bugfix: Haste: Hasted gestures were not being perceived by other wizards.
5. Bugfix: Spellcasting: Fixed a bug where hasted spells requiring a two-handed gesture completed twice if they were finished on the first turn of haste.
